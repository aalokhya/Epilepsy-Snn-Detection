# 🧠 Real-Time Epilepsy Detection using Neuromorphic Computing

This project showcases the application of **neuromorphic computing**—specifically **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**—for detecting epileptic seizures from synthetic EEG data. 
Built using the **Brian2** simulator, the model is optimized for **real-time**, **low-latency**, and **energy-efficient** classification of seizure events.

> ✅ No user interface or interactivity is provided. The system is designed purely as a trained backend model.  
> ✅ EEG data was synthetically generated to simulate realistic patterns.  
> ✅ The model performs effectively, demonstrating high accuracy with clean outputs.
